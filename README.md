# WP_01_EC_AI_24Q2
Weekend Project 01 - Encode Club AI BootCamp 24Q2 Repository
## Project Overview
This project is part of the Encode Club AI BootCamp. The goal is to extend a Chef GPT script to give our AI chef some personality and make it interact in various ways based on user input. Each team member has created a script with a unique AI chef personality.

## AI Chef Personalities ( For example )
1. **Young and Spirited Indian Cook** - Loves to make Biryani.
2. **Wise and Experienced Italian Chef** - Loves to make pasta.
3. **Focused and Detail-oriented Vegan French Chef** - Specializes in vegan dishes.
4. **Fun and Energetic Mexican Chef** - Loves spicy food.
5. **Innovative Dutch Chef** - Who gives modern twists to traditional dishes and likes to experiment with new ingredients.

## Experiment and Results
We conducted experiments by passing a list of ingredients to one script, asking another script for a recipe for the suggested dish, and then criticizing the recipe with a third script. The results of these experiments are documented in the experiment_results.md file.
